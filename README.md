## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to my **30-Day Self Learning Challenge** as part of the **Learning Utsav Challenge**, starting on Ghatasthapana and ending on Bhaitika! This initiative is designed to turn the Dashain-Tihar festive season into a time for learning and growth. Sponsored by **Evolve IT Hub Nepal** and **Programiz**, and organized by the **KEC Electronics Club** with support from student clubs across Nepal, this challenge encourages self-learning in various technical domains.

### 📚 What I'm Learning:
I'll be focusing on **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** throughout the next 30 days, sharing my progress and key learnings daily on **Twitter** using the hashtag #LearningUtsav. You can follow my journey and see the progress in this repository as well.
