            sustainedhigh blood sugar levels.[10][11]Diabetes is due to
            either thepancreasnot producing enoughinsulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to the
            hormone's effects.[12]Classic symptoms include thirst,polyuria, weight loss, andblurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health
            complications, including disorders of thecardiovascular system,eye,kidney, andnerves.[3]Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths
            every year,[9]with an estimated
            1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes.[10]The major types of diabetes aretype 1andtype 2.[13]The most common treatment for type 1 isinsulin
                replacement therapy(insulin injections), whileanti-diabetic medications(such asmetforminandsemaglutide) andlifestyle modificationscan be used to
            manage type 2.Gestational diabetes, a
            form that arises duringpregnancyin some women, normally
            resolves shortly after delivery.As of 2021, an estimated 537 million people had diabetes worldwide accounting for 10.5% of the adult
            population, with type 2 making up about 90% of all cases. TheWorld Health Organizationhas reported that diabetes was "among
            the top 10 causes of death in 2021, following a significant percentage increase of 95% since 2000."[14]It is estimated that by 2045, approximately 783 million
            adults, or 1 in 8, will be living with diabetes, representing a 46% increase from the current figures.[15]The prevalence of the disease continues to increase,
            most dramatically in low- and middle-income nations.[16]Rates are similar in women and men, with diabetes being
            the seventh leading cause of death globally.[17][18]The global expenditure on diabetes-related healthcare is
            an estimated US$760 billion a year.[19]Signs and symptoms[edit]Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetesRetinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are potential complications of diabetesThe classic symptoms of untreated diabetes arepolyuria,
            thirst, and weight loss.[20]Several other
            non-specific signs and symptoms may also occur, including fatigue, blurred vision, and genital itchiness due
            toCandidainfection.[20]About half of affected individuals may also be
            asymptomatic.[20]Type 1 presents
            abruptly following a pre-clinical phase, while type 2 has a more insidious onset; patients may remain
            asymptomatic for many years.[21]Diabetic ketoacidosisis a medical
            emergency that occurs most commonly in type 1, but may also occur in type 2 if it has been longstanding or
            if the individual has significant β-cell dysfunction.[22]Excessive production ofketone bodiesleads to signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting,
            abdominal pain, the smell ofacetonein the breath, deep
            breathing known asKussmaul breathing, and
            in severe casesdecreased level of consciousness.[22]Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic stateis another emergency
            characterized by dehydration secondary to severe hyperglycemia, with resultanthypernatremialeading to an altered mental state and possiblycoma.[23]Hypoglycemiais a recognized complication of insulin
            treatment used in diabetes.[24]An acute
            presentation can include mild symptoms such assweating, trembling, andpalpitations, to more serious effects includingimpaired cognition, confusion,seizures,coma, and rarely death.[24]Recurrent
            hypoglycemic episodes may lower the glycemic threshold at which symptoms occur, meaning mild symptoms may
            not appear before cognitive deterioration begins to occur.[24]Long-term complications[edit]Main article:Complications of diabetesThe major long-term complications of diabetes relate to damage toblood vesselsat bothmacrovascularandmicrovascularlevels.[25][26]Diabetes doubles the risk ofcardiovascular disease, and about
            75% of deaths in people with diabetes are due tocoronary artery disease.[27]Other macrovascular morbidities includestrokeandperipheral artery disease.[28]Microvascular disease affects theeyes,kidneys, andnerves.[25]Damage to the
            retina, known asdiabetic retinopathy,
            is the most common cause of blindness in people of working age.[20]The eyes can also be affected in other ways, including
            development ofcataractandglaucoma.[20]It is recommended that people with diabetes visit anoptometristorophthalmologistonce a
            year.[29]Diabetic nephropathyis a major cause
            ofchronic kidney disease,
            accounting for over 50% of patients ondialysisin the United States.[30]Diabetic neuropathy, damage to nerves,
            manifests in various ways, includingsensory loss,neuropathic pain, andautonomic
                dysfunction(such aspostural hypotension,diarrhoea, anderectile dysfunction).[20]Loss of pain sensation predisposes to trauma that can
            lead todiabetic foot problems(such asulceration), the most common cause of non-traumatic lower-limbamputation.[20]Hearing lossis another
            long-term complication associated with diabetes.[31]Based on extensive data and numerous cases of gallstone disease, it appears that a causal link might exist
            between type 2 diabetes and gallstones. People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing gallstones
            compared to those without diabetes.[32]There is a link betweencognitive deficitand diabetes; studies have shown that diabetic
            individuals are at a greater risk of cognitive decline, and have a greater rate of decline compared to those
            without the disease.[33]The condition also predisposes tofalls in the elderly, especially
            those treated withinsulin.[34]Causes[edit]Comparison of type 1 and 2 diabetes[35]FeatureType 1 diabetesType 2 diabetesOnsetSuddenGradualAge at onsetAny age; average age at diagnosis being 24.[36]Mostly in adultsBody sizeThin or normal[37]OftenobeseKetoacidosisCommonRareAutoantibodiesUsually presentAbsentEndogenous insulinLow or absentNormal, decreasedor increasedHeritability0.69 to 0.88[38][39][40]0.47 to 0.77[41]Prevalence(age standardized)<2 per 1,000[42]~6% (men), ~5% (women)[43]Diabetes is classified by theWorld Health Organizationinto six categories:type 1 diabetes,type 2 diabetes, hybrid forms of diabetes
            (includingslowly evolving, immune-mediated diabetes of adultsandketosis-prone type 2 diabetes),
            hyperglycemia first detected during pregnancy, "other specific types", and "unclassified diabetes".[44]Diabetes is a more variable disease than once thought,
            and individuals may have a combination of forms.[45]Type 1[edit]Main article:Type 1 diabetesType 1 accounts for 5 to 10% of diabetes cases and is the most common type diagnosed in patients under 20
            years;[46]however, the older
            term "juvenile-onset diabetes" is no longer used as onset in adulthood is not unusual.[30]The disease is
            characterized by loss of the insulin-producingbeta cellsof
            thepancreatic islets, leading to severe
            insulin deficiency, and can be further classified asimmune-mediatedoridiopathic(without known cause).[46]The majority of cases are immune-mediated, in which aT cell-mediatedautoimmuneattack causes loss of beta cells and thus insulin deficiency.[47]Patients often have
            irregular and unpredictable blood sugar levels due to very low insulin and an impaired counter-response to
            hypoglycemia.[48]Autoimmune attack in type 1 diabetes.Type 1 diabetes is partlyinherited, with
            multiple genes, including certainHLA genotypes, known to influence the risk of diabetes. In
            genetically susceptible people, the onset of diabetes can be triggered by one or moreenvironmental factors,[49]such as aviral infectionor diet. Several viruses have been
            implicated, but to date there is no stringent evidence to support this hypothesis in humans.[49][50]Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, and a significant proportion is diagnosed during adulthood.Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults(LADA) is the
            diagnostic term applied when type 1 diabetes develops in adults; it has a slower onset than the same
            condition in children. Given this difference, some use the unofficial term "type 1.5 diabetes" for this
            condition. Adults with LADA are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, based on age
            rather than a cause.[51]LADA leaves adults
            with higher levels of insulin production than type 1 diabetes, but not enough insulin production for healthy
            blood sugar levels.[52][53]Type 2[edit]Main article:Type 2 diabetesReduced insulin secretion or weaker effect of insulin on its receptor leads to high glucose
                content in the blood.Type 2 diabetes is characterized byinsulin
                resistance, which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion.[12]The defective
            responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve theinsulin receptor.[54]However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes
            mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of
            diabetes mellitus accounting for 95% of diabetes.[2]Many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence ofprediabetes(impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired
            glucose tolerance) before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes.[55]The progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes
            can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes ormedicationsthat improve insulin sensitivity or reduce theliver's glucose production.[56]Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to lifestyle factors and genetics.[57]A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important
            to the development of type 2 diabetes, includingobesity(defined by abody mass indexof greater than
            30), lack ofphysical activity, poordiet,stress, andurbanization.[35][58]Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in
            people of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100%
            of Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.[12]Even those who are not obese may have a highwaist–hip ratio.[12]Dietary factors such assugar-sweetened drinks are associated with an
            increased risk.[59][60]The type offatsin
            the diet is also important, withsaturated fatandtrans fatsincreasing the risk andpolyunsaturatedandmonounsaturated fatdecreasing the
            risk.[57]Eatingwhite riceexcessively may increase the risk of diabetes,
            especially in Chinese and Japanese people.[61]Lack of physical activity may increase the risk of
            diabetes in some people.[62]Adverse childhood experiences, including abuse, neglect,
            and household difficulties, increase the likelihood of type 2 diabetes later in life by 32%, withneglecthaving the strongest effect.[63]Antipsychotic medicationside effects (specifically
            metabolic abnormalities,dyslipidemiaand weight gain)
            are also potential risk factors.[64]Gestational diabetes[edit]Main article:Gestational diabetesGestational diabetes resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively
            inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2–10% of allpregnanciesand may improve or disappear after delivery.[65]It is recommended
            that all pregnant women get tested starting around 24–28 weeks gestation.[66]It is most often diagnosed in the second or third
            trimester because of the increase in insulin-antagonist hormone levels that occurs at this time.[66]However, after
            pregnancy approximately 5–10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have another form of diabetes,
            most commonly type 2.[65]Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires
            careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose
            monitoring, and in some cases, insulin may be required.[67]Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother.
            Risks to the baby includemacrosomia(high birth weight),congenital
                heartandcentral nervous
                systemabnormalities, andskeletal
                musclemalformations. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit fetalsurfactantproduction and causeinfant
                respiratory distress syndrome. Ahigh
                blood bilirubin levelmay result fromred blood cell
                destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental
            perfusion due to vascular impairment.Labor
                inductionmay be indicated with decreased placental function. Acaesarean sectionmay be performed if there is markedfetal distress[68]or an increased risk of injury associated with
            macrosomia, such asshoulder dystocia.[69]Other types[edit]Maturity onset diabetes of the young(MODY) is a rareautosomal dominantinherited form of
            diabetes, due to one of several single-gene mutations causing defects in insulin production.[70]It is significantly less common than the three main
            types, constituting 1–2% of all cases. The name of this disease refers to early hypotheses as to its nature.
            Being due to a defective gene, this disease varies in age at presentation and in severity according to the
            specific gene defect; thus, there are at least 13 subtypes of MODY. People with MODY often can control it
            without using insulin.[71]Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin
            levels are normal, which is what separates it from type 2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon.
            Genetic mutations (autosomalormitochondrial) can lead to defects in beta cell
            function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that
            causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example,chronic pancreatitisandcystic fibrosis). Diseases associated with
            excessive secretion ofinsulin-antagonistichormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once thehormoneexcess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins
            damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increaseinsulin resistance(especiallyglucocorticoidswhich can provoke "steroid diabetes"). TheICD-10(1992) diagnostic entity,malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus(ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by
            theWorld Health
                Organization(WHO) when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999.[72]Yet another form of diabetes that people may develop isdouble diabetes. This is when a type 1 diabetic
            becomes insulin resistant, the hallmark for type 2 diabetes or has a family history for type 2 diabetes.[73]It was first discovered in 1990 or 1991.The following is a list of disorders that may increase the risk of diabetes:[74]Genetic defects of β-cell functionMaturity onset diabetes of the youngMitochondrial DNA mutationsGenetic defects in insulin processing or insulin actionDefects inproinsulinconversionInsulin gene mutationsInsulin receptor mutationsExocrine pancreatic defects (seeType 3c

                humans during the course of a day with three meals. One of the effects of asugar-rich vs astarch-rich meal is
                highlighted.Mechanism of insulin release in normal pancreaticbeta cells. Insulin production is more or less constant within the beta cells.
                Its release is triggered by food, chiefly food containing absorbable glucose.Insulinis the principal hormone that regulates the uptake ofglucosefrom the blood into most cells of the body, especially
            liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via theIGF-1.[76]Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of
            itsreceptorsplay a central
            role in all forms of diabetes mellitus.[77]The body obtains glucose from three main sources: the intestinal absorption of food; the breakdown ofglycogen(glycogenolysis), the storage form of glucose found in the liver; andgluconeogenesis, the generation of glucose from
            non-carbohydrate substrates in the body.[78]Insulin plays a critical role in regulating glucose
            levels in the body. Insulin can inhibit the breakdown of glycogen or the process of gluconeogenesis, it can
            stimulate the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and it can stimulate the storage of glucose in
            the form of glycogen.[78]Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in theislets of Langerhansin the pancreas, in response
            to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body's
            cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for
            storage. Lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown
            of glycogen to glucose. This process is mainly controlled by the hormoneglucagon, which acts in the opposite manner to insulin.[79]If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, or if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance), or if the insulin
            itself is defective, then glucose is not absorbed properly by the body cells that require it, and is not
            stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistently high levels of blood glucose,
            poorprotein synthesis, and other
            metabolic derangements, such as metabolicacidosisin cases of
            complete insulin deficiency.[78]When there is too much glucose in the blood for a long time, thekidneyscannot absorb it all (reach a threshold ofreabsorption) and the extra glucose gets passed out of the body throughurine(glycosuria).[80]This increases theosmotic pressureof the urine and inhibits
            reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume is replaced osmotically from
            water in body cells and other body compartments, causingdehydrationand increased thirst (polydipsia).[78]In addition, intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates
            appetite leading to excessive food intake (polyphagia).[81]Diagnosis[edit]See also:Glycated hemoglobinandGlucose tolerance testDiabetes mellitus is diagnosed with a test for the glucose content in the blood, and is diagnosed by
            demonstrating any one of the following:[72]Fasting plasma glucose
                    level≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). For this test, blood is taken after a period of
                fasting, i.e. in the morning before breakfast, after the patient had sufficient time to fast overnight
                or at least 8 hours before the test.Plasma glucose≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load as in aglucose tolerance test(OGTT)Symptoms of high blood sugar and plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) either while
                fasting or not fastingGlycated hemoglobin(HbA1C) ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5DCCT%).[82]WHO diabetes diagnostic criteria[83][84]editCondition2-hour glucoseFasting glucoseHbA1cUnitmmol/Lmg/dLmmol/Lmg/dLmmol/molDCCT %Normal< 7.8< 140< 6.1< 110< 42< 6.0Impaired fasting glycaemia< 7.8< 1406.1–7.0110–12542–466.0–6.4Impaired glucose tolerance≥ 7.8≥ 140< 7.0< 12642–466.0–6.4Diabetes
                            mellitus≥ 11.1≥ 200≥ 7.0≥ 126≥ 48≥ 6.5A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal high blood sugar, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of
            the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the
            ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes
            two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.[85]According to the current definition, two fasting glucose
            measurements at or above 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.Per the WHO, people with fasting glucose levels from 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (110 to 125 mg/dL) are
            considered to haveimpaired fasting glucose.[86]People with plasma glucose at or above 7.8 mmol/L
            (140 mg/dL), but not over 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), two hours after a 75 gram oral
            glucose load are considered to haveimpaired glucose tolerance. Of these two prediabetic states, the
            latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus, as well as
            cardiovascular disease.[87]TheAmerican Diabetes
                Association(ADA) since 2003 uses a slightly different range for impaired fasting glucose of 5.6 to
            6.9 mmol/L (100 to 125 mg/dL).[88]Glycated hemoglobinis better thanfasting glucosefor
            determining risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause.[89]Prevention[edit]See also:Prevention of type 2
                diabetesThere is no knownpreventivemeasure
            for type 1 diabetes.[2]However, islet autoimmunity and multiple antibodies can
            be a strong predictor of the onset of type 1 diabetes.[90]Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all
            cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed[91]by maintaining anormal body weight, engaging in physical activity,
            and eating a healthy diet.[2]Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes
            per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.[92]Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to
            prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich inwhole
                grainsandfiber, and choosing good fats,
            such as thepolyunsaturated fatsfound
            in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.[93]Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and
            other sources ofsaturated fatcan also help prevent
            diabetes.[93]Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased
            risk of diabetes and its complications, sosmoking cessationcan be an important preventive measure as well.[94]The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet,
            physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that
            the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and
            cultural change:globalization, urbanization,
            population aging, and the generalhealth policyenvironment.[95]Comorbidity[edit]Diabetes patients' comorbidities have a significant impact on medical expenses and related costs. It has been
            demonstrated that patients with diabetes are more likely to experience respiratory, urinary tract, and skin
            infections, develop atherosclerosis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, putting them at increased
            risk of infection and complications that require medical attention.[96]Patients with diabetes mellitus are more likely to
            experience certain infections, such as COVID-19, with prevalence rates ranging from 5.3 to 35.5%.[97][98]Maintaining adequate glycemic control is the primary
            goal of diabetes management since it is critical to managing diabetes and preventing or postponing such
            complications.[99]Management[edit]Main article:Diabetes managementDiabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels close to normal, without causing low blood
            sugar.[100]This can usually
            be accomplished with dietary changes,[101]exercise, weight
            loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications).[100]Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are
            far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[100][102]The goal of treatment is an A1C level below 7%.[103][104]Attention is also paid to other health problems that may
            accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These includesmoking,high blood pressure,metabolic syndromeobesity, and lack of regularexercise.[100][105]Specialized footwearis widely used to reduce the risk ofdiabetic foot ulcersby relieving the
            pressure on the foot.[106][107][108]Foot examination for patients living with diabetes
            should be done annually which includes sensation testing, footbiomechanics, vascular integrity and foot structure.[109]Concerning those with severemental illness, the
            efficacy oftype 2 diabetesself-management
            interventions is still poorly explored, with insufficient scientific evidence to show whether these
            interventions have similar results to those observed in the general population.[110]Lifestyle[edit]See also:Diet in diabetesPeople with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, dietary changes, and
            exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levelswithin acceptable
                bounds. In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle
            modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.[111][112]Weight losscan prevent progression from prediabetes todiabetes type 2,
            decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, or result in a partial remission in people with diabetes.[113][114]No single dietary
            pattern is best for all people with diabetes.[115]Healthy dietary patterns, such as theMediterranean diet,low-carbohydrate diet, orDASH diet, are often recommended, although evidence does
            not support one over the others.[113][114]According to the ADA, "reducing overall carbohydrate
            intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia", and for
            individuals with type 2 diabetes who cannot meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti-glycemic
            medications is a priority,low or
                very-low carbohydrate dietsare a viable approach.[114]For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet
            that achieves weight loss is effective.[115][116]A 2020 Cochrane systematic review compared several non-nutritive sweeteners to sugar, placebo and a nutritive
            low-calorie sweetener (tagatose), but the results were unclear
            for effects on HbA1c, body weight and adverse events.[117]The studies included were mainly of very low-certainty
            and did not report on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality or
            socioeconomic effects.[117]Medications[edit]Main article:Diabetes medicationGlucose control[edit]See also:Anti-diabetic medicationMost medications used to treat diabetes act by loweringblood sugar
                levelsthrough different mechanisms. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes
            maintain tight glucose control – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – they
            experience fewer complications, such askidney problemsoreye problems.[118][119]There is, however, debate as to whether this is
            appropriate andcost effectivefor people later in life in whom the risk of hypoglycemia may be more significant.[120]There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Type 1 diabetes requires treatment
            withinsulin, ideally using a "basal bolus" regimen that most
            closely matches normal insulin release: long-acting insulin for thebasal rateand short-acting insulin with meals.[121]Type 2 diabetes is generally treated with medication
            that is taken by mouth (e.g.metformin) although some
            eventually require injectable treatment with insulin orGLP-1 agonists.[122]Metforminis generally recommended as a first-line treatment
            for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.[7]It works by decreasing the liver's production of
            glucose, and increasing the amount of glucose stored in peripheral tissue.[123]Several other groups of drugs, mainly oral medication,
            may also decrease blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. These include agents that increase insulin release (sulfonylureas), agents that decrease absorption of
            sugar from the intestines (acarbose), agents that inhibit the
            enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) that inactivates incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP (sitagliptin), agents that make the body more sensitive
            to insulin (thiazolidinedione) and agents
            that increase the excretion of glucose in the urine (SGLT2 inhibitors).[123]When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting
            formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[7]Some severe cases of type 2 diabetes may also be treated with insulin, which is increased gradually until
            glucose targets are reached.[7][124]Blood pressure lowering[edit]Cardiovascular diseaseis a serious
            complication associated with diabetes, and many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment
            targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes.[125]However, there is only limited evidence regarding what
            the lower targets should be. A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than
            140 mmHg,[126]and a subsequent
            systematic review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between
            130 – 140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.[127]2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should
            receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal
            disease, cardiovascular events, and death.[128]There is some evidence thatangiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEIs)
            are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such asangiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs),[129]oraliskirenin preventing cardiovascular disease.[130]Although a more recent review found similar effects of
            ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes.[131]There is no evidence that combining ACEIs and ARBs
            provides additional benefits.[131]Aspirin[edit]The use ofaspirinto prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes
            is controversial.[128]Aspirin is
            recommended by some in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease; however, routine use of aspirin has
            not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[132]2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations for
            aspirin use (based on expert consensus or clinical experience) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable
            in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease (10-year cardiovascular
            disease risk, 5–10%).[128]National
            guidelines for England and Wales by theNational Institute for Health and Care
                Excellence(NICE) recommend against the use of aspirin in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who
            do not have confirmed cardiovascular disease.[121][122]Surgery[edit]Weight loss surgeryin those withobesityand type 2 diabetes is often an effective measure.[133]Many are able to
            maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery[134]and long-term mortality is decreased.[135]There is, however,
            a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[136]Thebody mass indexcutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet
            clear.[135]It is recommended
            that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under
            control.[137]Apancreas transplantis occasionally considered for people with type 1 diabetes who have severe complications of their
            disease, includingend stage kidney
                diseaserequiringkidney
                transplantation.[138]Diabetic peripheral neuropathy(DPN)
            affects 30% of all diabetes patients.[139]When DPN is
            superimposed withnerve
                compression, DPN may be treatable with multiplenerve decompressions.[140][141]The theory is that DPN predisposesperipheral nervesto
            compression at anatomical sites of narrowing, and that the majority of DPN symptoms are actually
            attributable to nerve compression, a treatable condition, rather than DPN itself.[142][143]The surgery is associated with lowerpain scores, highertwo-point discrimination(a
            measure of sensory improvement), lower rate ofulcerations, fewer
            falls (in the case of lower extremity decompression), and feweramputations.[143][144][145][141]Self-management and support[edit]In countries using ageneral
                practitionersystem, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with
            hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or
            research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care in a team
            approach. Evidence has shown that social prescribing led to slight improvements in blood sugar control for
            people with type 2 diabetes.[146]Hometelehealthsupport can be an effective management
            technique.[147]The use oftechnologyto deliver educational programs for
            adults with type 2 diabetes includes computer-based self-management interventions to collect for tailored
            responses to facilitate self-management.[148]There is no adequate evidence to support effects oncholesterol,blood pressure,behavioral change(such asphysical activitylevels and dietary),depression, weight andhealth-related quality of life, nor in other biological,
            cognitive or emotional outcomes.[148][149]Epidemiology[edit]Main article:Epidemiology of diabetesRates of diabetes worldwide in 2014. The worldwide prevalence was 9.2%.Mortality rate of diabetes worldwide in 2012 per million inhabitants28–9192–114115–141142–163164–184185–209210–247248–309310–404405–1879In 2017, 425 million people had diabetes worldwide,[150]up from an estimated 382 million people in 2013[151]and from
            108 million in 1980.[152]Accounting for the shifting age structure of the global
            population, the prevalence of diabetes is 8.8% among adults, nearly double the rate of 4.7% in 1980.[150][152]Type 2 makes
            up about 90% of the cases.[17][35]Some data indicate rates are roughly equal in women and
            men,[17]but male excess in
            diabetes has been found in many populations with higher type 2 incidence, possibly due to sex-related
            differences in insulin sensitivity, consequences of obesity and regional body fat deposition, and other
            contributing factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco smoking, and alcohol intake.[153][154]The WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause
            of death.[155][152]However, another
            2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of
            cardiovascular disease and other associated complications (e.g. kidney failure), which often lead to
            premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[152][156]For example, in 2017, theInternational
                Diabetes Federation(IDF) estimated that diabetes resulted in 4.0 million deaths worldwide,[150]using modeling to
            estimate the total number of deaths that could be directly or indirectly attributed to diabetes.[150]Diabetes occurs throughout the world but is more common (especially type 2) in more developed countries. The
            greatest increase in rates has, however, been seen in low- and middle-income countries,[152]where more than
            80% of diabetic deaths occur.[157]The fastest
            prevalence increase is expected to occur in Asia and Africa, where most people with diabetes will probably
            live in 2030.[158]The increase in
            rates in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including
            increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition,
            marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and
            saturated fats, sometimes referred to as the "Western-style" diet).[152][158]The global number of diabetes cases might increase by
            48% between 2017 and 2045.[150]As of 2020, 38% of all US adults had prediabetes.[159]Prediabetesis an early stage of diabetes.History[edit]Main article:History of diabetesDiabetes was one of the first diseases described,[160]with anEgyptianmanuscript fromc.1500BCEmentioning "too great emptying of the urine."[161]TheEbers papyrusincludes a
            recommendation for a drink to take in such cases.[162]The first described cases are believed to have been
            type 1 diabetes.[161]Indian physicians around the same time identified the
            disease and classified it asmadhumehaor "honey urine", noting the urine would attract ants.[161][162]The term "diabetes" or "to pass through" was first used in 230 BCE by the GreekApollonius of
                Memphis.[161]The disease was considered rare during the time of theRoman empire, withGalencommenting he had only seen two cases during his career.[161]This is possibly
            due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the
            advanced stage of the disease. Galen named the disease "diarrhea of the urine" (diarrhea urinosa).[163]The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that ofAretaeus of Cappadocia(2nd or
            early 3rdcentury CE). He described the symptoms and the course of the
            disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of the "Pneumatic School". He
            hypothesized a correlation between diabetes and other diseases, and he discussed differential diagnosis from
            the snakebite, which also provokes excessive thirst. His work remained unknown in the West until 1552, when
            the first Latin edition was published in Venice.[163]Two types of diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physiciansSushrutaandCharakain 400–500 CE with one type being associated with youth and another
            type with being overweight.[161]Effective treatment was not developed until the early
            part of the 20th century when CanadiansFrederick BantingandCharles Bestisolated and purified insulin in 1921 and
            1922.[161]This was followed
            by the development of the long-acting insulinNPHin the
            1940s.[161]Etymology[edit]The worddiabetes(/ˌdaɪ.əˈbiːtiːz/or/ˌdaɪ.əˈbiːtɪs/) comes fromLatindiabētēs, which in turn comes fromAncient Greekδιαβήτης(diabētēs), which literally
            means "a passer through; asiphon".[164]Ancient GreekphysicianAretaeus of Cappadocia(fl.1stcenturyCE) used that word, with the intended meaning "excessive
            discharge of urine", as the name for the disease.[165][166]Ultimately, the word comes from Greekδιαβαίνειν(diabainein), meaning "to pass through",[164]which is composed
            ofδια- (dia-), meaning "through" andβαίνειν(bainein), meaning "to go".[165]The word "diabetes" is first recorded in English, in the
            formdiabete, in a medical text written around 1425.The wordmellitus(/məˈlaɪtəs/or/ˈmɛlɪtəs/) comes from the classical Latin
            wordmellītus, meaning "mellite"[167](i.e. sweetened
            with honey;[167]honey-sweet[168]). The Latin word comes frommell-, which comes frommel, meaning "honey";[167][168]sweetness;[168]pleasant
            thing,[168]and the suffix -ītus,[167]whose meaning is the same as that of the English suffix
            "-ite".[169]It wasThomas Williswho in 1675 added "mellitus" to the
            word "diabetes" as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a person with diabetes had a
            sweet taste (glycosuria). This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese,
            Egyptians, and Indians.[170]Society and culture[edit]Further information:List of films
                featuring diabetesThe 1989 "St. Vincent
                Declaration"[171][172]was the result of international efforts to improve the
            care accorded to those with diabetes. Doing so is important not only in terms of quality of life and life
            expectancy but also economically – expenses due to diabetes have been shown to be a major drain on
            health – and productivity-related resources for healthcare systems and governments.Several countries established more and less successful national diabetes programmes to improve treatment of
            the disease.[173]Diabetes stigma[edit]Diabetes stigma describes the negative attitudes, judgment, discrimination, or prejudice against people with
            diabetes. Often, the stigma stems from the idea that diabetes (particularly Type 2 diabetes) resulted from
            poor lifestyle and unhealthy food choices rather than other causal factors like genetics and social
            determinants of health.[174]Manifestation of
            stigma can be seen throughout different cultures and contexts. Scenarios include diabetes statuses affecting
            marriage proposals, workplace-employment, and social standing in communities.[175]Stigma is also seen internally, as people with diabetes can also have negative beliefs about themselves.
            Often these cases of self-stigma are associated with higher diabetes-specific distress, lower self-efficacy,
            and poorer provider-patient interactions during diabetes care.[176]Racial and economic inequalities[edit]Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with higher prevalence of diabetes compared to
            non-minority individuals.[177]While US adults
            overall have a 40% chance of developing type 2 diabetes, Hispanic/Latino adults chance is more than 50%.[178]African Americans also are much more likely to be
            diagnosed with diabetes compared to White Americans. Asians have increased risk of diabetes as diabetes can
            develop at lower BMI due to differences in visceral fat compared to other races. For Asians, diabetes can
            develop at a younger age and lower body fat compared to other groups. Additionally, diabetes is highly
            underreported in Asian American people, as 1 in 3 cases are undiagnosed compared to the average 1 in 5 for
            the nation.[179]People with diabetes who have neuropathic symptoms such as numbness or tingling in feet or hands are twice as
            likely to beunemployedas those
            without the symptoms.[180]In 2010, diabetes-related emergency room (ER) visit rates in the United States were higher among people from
            the lowest income communities (526 per 10,000 population) than from the highest income communities (236 per
            10,000 population). Approximately 9.4% of diabetes-related ER visits were for the uninsured.[181]Naming[edit]The term "type 1 diabetes" has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes,
            juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the term "type 2 diabetes" has
            replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and
            noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard
            nomenclature.[182]Diabetes mellitus is also occasionally known as "sugar diabetes" to differentiate it fromdiabetes insipidus.[183]Other animals[edit]Main articles:Diabetes in dogsandDiabetes in catsDiabetes can occur in mammals or reptiles.[184][185]Birds do not develop diabetes because of their unusually
            high tolerance for elevated blood glucose levels.[186]In animals, diabetes is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly
            affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male
            cats are more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are
            particularly likely to develop diabetes, such asMiniature
                Poodles.[187]Feline diabetes is strikingly similar to human type 2 diabetes. TheBurmese,Russian Blue,Abyssinian, andNorwegian Forestcat breeds are at higher risk than other breeds. Overweight cats are also at higher risk.[188]The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals
            are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals.
            The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of
            emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.[187]

Diabetes mellitus, often known simply as diabetes, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by
            sustained high blood sugar levels.[10][11] Diabetes is due to
            either the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to the
            hormone's effects.[12] Classic symptoms include thirst, polyuria, weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health
            complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves.[3] Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths
            every year,[9] with an estimated
            1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes.[10]

The major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2.[13] The most common treatment for type 1 is insulin
                replacement therapy (insulin injections), while anti-diabetic medications (such as metformin and semaglutide) and
            lifestyle modifications can be used to
            manage type 2. Gestational diabetes, a
            form that arises during pregnancy in some women, normally
            resolves shortly after delivery.

As of 2021, an estimated 537 million people had diabetes worldwide accounting for 10.5% of the adult
            population, with type 2 making up about 90% of all cases. The World Health Organization has reported that diabetes was "among
            the top 10 causes of death in 2021, following a significant percentage increase of 95% since 2000."[14] It is estimated that by 2045, approximately 783 million
            adults, or 1 in 8, will be living with diabetes, representing a 46% increase from the current figures.[15] The prevalence of the disease continues to increase,
            most dramatically in low- and middle-income nations.[16] Rates are similar in women and men, with diabetes being
            the seventh leading cause of death globally.[17][18] The global expenditure on diabetes-related healthcare is
            an estimated US$760 billion a year.[19]

The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are polyuria,
            thirst, and weight loss.[20] Several other
            non-specific signs and symptoms may also occur, including fatigue, blurred vision, and genital itchiness due
            to Candida infection.[20] About half of affected individuals may also be
            asymptomatic.[20] Type 1 presents
            abruptly following a pre-clinical phase, while type 2 has a more insidious onset; patients may remain
            asymptomatic for many years.[21]

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical
            emergency that occurs most commonly in type 1, but may also occur in type 2 if it has been longstanding or
            if the individual has significant β-cell dysfunction.[22] Excessive production of ketone bodies leads to signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting,
            abdominal pain, the smell of acetone in the breath, deep
            breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, and
            in severe cases decreased level of consciousness.[22] Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is another emergency
            characterized by dehydration secondary to severe hyperglycemia, with resultant hypernatremia leading to an altered mental state and possibly coma.[23]

Hypoglycemia is a recognized complication of insulin
            treatment used in diabetes.[24] An acute
            presentation can include mild symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and palpitations, to more serious effects including impaired cognition, confusion, seizures, coma, and rarely death.[24] Recurrent
            hypoglycemic episodes may lower the glycemic threshold at which symptoms occur, meaning mild symptoms may
            not appear before cognitive deterioration begins to occur.[24]

Complications of diabetes
The major long-term complications of diabetes relate to damage to blood vessels at both macrovascular and microvascular levels.[25][26] Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease, and about
            75% of deaths in people with diabetes are due to coronary artery disease.[27] Other macrovascular morbidities include stroke and peripheral artery disease.[28]

Microvascular disease affects the eyes, kidneys, and nerves.[25] Damage to the
            retina, known as diabetic retinopathy,
            is the most common cause of blindness in people of working age.[20] The eyes can also be affected in other ways, including
            development of cataract and glaucoma.[20] It is recommended that people with diabetes visit an optometrist or ophthalmologist once a
            year.[29]

Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause
            of chronic kidney disease,
            accounting for over 50% of patients on dialysis
            in the United States.[30] Diabetic neuropathy, damage to nerves,
            manifests in various ways, including sensory loss, neuropathic pain, and autonomic
                dysfunction (such as postural hypotension, diarrhoea, and erectile dysfunction).[20] Loss of pain sensation predisposes to trauma that can
            lead to diabetic foot problems (such as ulceration), the most common cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputation.[20]

Based on extensive data and numerous cases of gallstone disease, it appears that a causal link might exist
            between type 2 diabetes and gallstones. People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing gallstones
            compared to those without diabetes.[32]

There is a link between cognitive deficit and diabetes; studies have shown that diabetic
            individuals are at a greater risk of cognitive decline, and have a greater rate of decline compared to those
            without the disease.[33] The condition also predisposes to falls in the elderly, especially
            those treated with insulin.[34]

Diabetes is classified by the World Health Organization into six categories: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, hybrid forms of diabetes
            (including slowly evolving, immune-mediated diabetes of adults and
            ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes),
            hyperglycemia first detected during pregnancy, "other specific types", and "unclassified diabetes".[44] Diabetes is a more variable disease than once thought,
            and individuals may have a combination of forms.[45]

Type 1 diabetes

            Type 1 accounts for 5 to 10% of diabetes cases and is the most common type diagnosed in patients under 20
            years;[46] however, the older
            term "juvenile-onset diabetes" is no longer used as onset in adulthood is not unusual.[30] The disease is
            characterized by loss of the insulin-producing beta cells of
            the pancreatic islets, leading to severe
            insulin deficiency, and can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic (without known cause).[46] The majority of cases are immune-mediated, in which a T cell-mediated autoimmune attack causes loss of beta cells and thus insulin deficiency.[47] Patients often have
            irregular and unpredictable blood sugar levels due to very low insulin and an impaired counter-response to
            hypoglycemia.[48]

Autoimmune attack in type 1 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is partly inherited, with
            multiple genes, including certain HLA genotypes, known to influence the risk of diabetes. In
            genetically susceptible people, the onset of diabetes can be triggered by one or more environmental factors,[49] such as a viral infection or diet. Several viruses have been
            implicated, but to date there is no stringent evidence to support this hypothesis in humans.[49][50]

Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, and a significant proportion is diagnosed during adulthood. Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is the
            diagnostic term applied when type 1 diabetes develops in adults; it has a slower onset than the same
            condition in children. Given this difference, some use the unofficial term "type 1.5 diabetes" for this
            condition. Adults with LADA are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, based on age
            rather than a cause.[51] LADA leaves adults
            with higher levels of insulin production than type 1 diabetes, but not enough insulin production for healthy
            blood sugar levels.[52][53]

Type 2 diabetes
Reduced insulin secretion or weaker effect of insulin on its receptor leads to high glucose
                content in the blood.
Reduced insulin secretion or weaker effect of insulin on its receptor leads to high glucose
                content in the blood.
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin
                resistance, which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion.[12] The defective
            responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor.[54] However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes
            mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of
            diabetes mellitus accounting for 95% of diabetes.[2] Many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired
            glucose tolerance) before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes.[55] The progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes
            can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes or medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce the liver's glucose production.[56]

Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to lifestyle factors and genetics.[57] A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important
            to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity
            (defined by a body mass index of greater than
            30), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization.[35][58] Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in
            people of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100%
            of Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.[12] Even those who are not obese may have a high waist–hip ratio.[12]

Dietary factors such as sugar-sweetened drinks are associated with an
            increased risk.[59][60] The type of fats in
            the diet is also important, with saturated fat and
            trans fats increasing the risk and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the
            risk.[57] Eating white rice excessively may increase the risk of diabetes,
            especially in Chinese and Japanese people.[61] Lack of physical activity may increase the risk of

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively
            inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2–10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery.[65] It is recommended
            that all pregnant women get tested starting around 24–28 weeks gestation.[66] It is most often diagnosed in the second or third
            trimester because of the increase in insulin-antagonist hormone levels that occurs at this time.[66] However, after
            pregnancy approximately 5–10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have another form of diabetes,
            most commonly type 2.[65] Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires
            careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose
            monitoring, and in some cases, insulin may be required.[67]

Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother.
            Risks to the baby include macrosomia
            (high birth weight), congenital
                heart and central nervous
                system abnormalities, and skeletal
                muscle malformations. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause infant
                respiratory distress syndrome. A high
                blood bilirubin level may result from red blood cell
                destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental
            perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor
                induction may be indicated with decreased placental function. A caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress[68] or an increased risk of injury associated with
            macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia.[69]

Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare
            autosomal dominant inherited form of
            diabetes, due to one of several single-gene mutations causing defects in insulin production.[70] It is significantly less common than the three main
            types, constituting 1–2% of all cases. The name of this disease refers to early hypotheses as to its nature.
            Being due to a defective gene, this disease varies in age at presentation and in severity according to the
            specific gene defect; thus, there are at least 13 subtypes of MODY. People with MODY often can control it
            without using insulin.[71]

Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin
            levels are normal, which is what separates it from type 2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon.
            Genetic mutations (autosomal or mitochondrial) can lead to defects in beta cell
            function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that
            causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis). Diseases associated with
            excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic
            hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins
            damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase insulin resistance (especially glucocorticoids which can provoke "steroid diabetes"). The ICD-10
            (1992) diagnostic entity, malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by
            the World Health
                Organization (WHO) when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999.[72] Yet another form of diabetes that people may develop is
            double diabetes. This is when a type 1 diabetic
            becomes insulin resistant, the hallmark for type 2 diabetes or has a family history for type 2 diabetes.[73] It was first discovered in 1990 or 1991.

Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially
            liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the IGF-1.[76] Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of
            its receptors play a central
            role in all forms of diabetes mellitus.[77]

The body obtains glucose from three main sources: the intestinal absorption of food; the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis), the storage form of glucose found in the liver; and gluconeogenesis, the generation of glucose from
            non-carbohydrate substrates in the body.[78] Insulin plays a critical role in regulating glucose
            levels in the body. Insulin can inhibit the breakdown of glycogen or the process of gluconeogenesis, it can
            stimulate the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and it can stimulate the storage of glucose in
            the form of glycogen.[78]

Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, in response
            to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body's
            cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for
            storage. Lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown
            of glycogen to glucose. This process is mainly controlled by the hormone glucagon, which acts in the opposite manner to insulin.[79]

If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, or if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance), or if the insulin
            itself is defective, then glucose is not absorbed properly by the body cells that require it, and is not
            stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistently high levels of blood glucose,
            poor protein synthesis, and other
            metabolic derangements, such as metabolic acidosis in cases of
            complete insulin deficiency.[78]

When there is too much glucose in the blood for a long time, the kidneys cannot absorb it all (reach a threshold of reabsorption) and the extra glucose gets passed out of the body through urine (glycosuria).[80] This increases the
            osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits
            reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume is replaced osmotically from
            water in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst (polydipsia).[78] In addition, intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates
            appetite leading to excessive food intake (polyphagia).[81]

A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal high blood sugar, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of
            the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the
            ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes
            two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.[85] According to the current definition, two fasting glucose
            measurements at or above 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.

Per the WHO, people with fasting glucose levels from 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (110 to 125 mg/dL) are
            considered to have impaired fasting glucose.[86] People with plasma glucose at or above 7.8 mmol/L
            (140 mg/dL), but not over 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), two hours after a 75 gram oral
            glucose load are considered to have impaired glucose tolerance. Of these two prediabetic states, the
            latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus, as well as
            cardiovascular disease.[87] The American Diabetes
                Association (ADA) since 2003 uses a slightly different range for impaired fasting glucose of 5.6 to
            6.9 mmol/L (100 to 125 mg/dL).[88]

Prevention of type 2
                diabetes
There is no known preventive measure
            for type 1 diabetes.[2] However, islet autoimmunity and multiple antibodies can
            be a strong predictor of the onset of type 1 diabetes.[90] Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all
            cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed[91] by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity,
            and eating a healthy diet.[2] Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes
            per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.[92] Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to
            prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole
                grains and fiber, and choosing good fats,
            such as the polyunsaturated fats found
            in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.[93] Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and
            other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent
            diabetes.[93] Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased
            risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.[94]

The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet,
            physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that
            the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and
            cultural change: globalization, urbanization,
            population aging, and the general health policy
            environment.[95]

Diabetes patients' comorbidities have a significant impact on medical expenses and related costs. It has been
            demonstrated that patients with diabetes are more likely to experience respiratory, urinary tract, and skin
            infections, develop atherosclerosis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, putting them at increased
            risk of infection and complications that require medical attention.[96] Patients with diabetes mellitus are more likely to
            experience certain infections, such as COVID-19, with prevalence rates ranging from 5.3 to 35.5%.[97][98] Maintaining adequate glycemic control is the primary
            goal of diabetes management since it is critical to managing diabetes and preventing or postponing such
            complications.[99]

Diabetes management
Diabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels close to normal, without causing low blood
            sugar.[100] This can usually
            be accomplished with dietary changes,[101] exercise, weight
            loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications).[100]

Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are
            far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[100][102] The goal of treatment is an A1C level below 7%.[103][104] Attention is also paid to other health problems that may
            accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These include smoking, high blood pressure,
            metabolic syndrome obesity, and lack of regular exercise.[100][105] Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving the
            pressure on the foot.[106][107][108] Foot examination for patients living with diabetes
            should be done annually which includes sensation testing, foot biomechanics, vascular integrity and foot structure.[109]

Concerning those with severe mental illness, the
            efficacy of type 2 diabetes self-management
            interventions is still poorly explored, with insufficient scientific evidence to show whether these
            interventions have similar results to those observed in the general population.[110]

People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, dietary changes, and
            exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable
                bounds. In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle
            modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.[111][112]

Weight loss can prevent progression from prediabetes to
            diabetes type 2,
            decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, or result in a partial remission in people with diabetes.[113][114] No single dietary
            pattern is best for all people with diabetes.[115] Healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, low-carbohydrate diet, or DASH diet, are often recommended, although evidence does
            not support one over the others.[113][114] According to the ADA, "reducing overall carbohydrate
            intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia", and for
            individuals with type 2 diabetes who cannot meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti-glycemic
            medications is a priority, low or
                very-low carbohydrate diets are a viable approach.[114] For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet
            that achieves weight loss is effective.[115][116]

A 2020 Cochrane systematic review compared several non-nutritive sweeteners to sugar, placebo and a nutritive
            low-calorie sweetener (tagatose), but the results were unclear
            for effects on HbA1c, body weight and adverse events.[117] The studies included were mainly of very low-certainty
            and did not report on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality or
            socioeconomic effects.[117]

Anti-diabetic medication
Most medications used to treat diabetes act by lowering blood sugar
                levels through different mechanisms. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes
            maintain tight glucose control – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – they
            experience fewer complications, such as kidney problems or eye problems.[118][119] There is, however, debate as to whether this is
            appropriate and cost effective
            for people later in life in whom the risk of hypoglycemia may be more significant.[120]

There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Type 1 diabetes requires treatment
            with insulin, ideally using a "basal bolus" regimen that most
            closely matches normal insulin release: long-acting insulin for the basal rate and short-acting insulin with meals.[121] Type 2 diabetes is generally treated with medication
            that is taken by mouth (e.g. metformin) although some
            eventually require injectable treatment with insulin or GLP-1 agonists.[122]

Metformin is generally recommended as a first-line treatment
            for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.[7] It works by decreasing the liver's production of
            glucose, and increasing the amount of glucose stored in peripheral tissue.[123] Several other groups of drugs, mainly oral medication,
            may also decrease blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. These include agents that increase insulin release (sulfonylureas), agents that decrease absorption of
            sugar from the intestines (acarbose), agents that inhibit the
            enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) that inactivates incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP (sitagliptin), agents that make the body more sensitive
            to insulin (thiazolidinedione) and agents
            that increase the excretion of glucose in the urine (SGLT2 inhibitors).[123] When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting
            formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[7]

Some severe cases of type 2 diabetes may also be treated with insulin, which is increased gradually until
            glucose targets are reached.[7][124]

Cardiovascular disease is a serious
            complication associated with diabetes, and many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment
            targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes.[125] However, there is only limited evidence regarding what
            the lower targets should be. A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than
            140 mmHg,[126] and a subsequent
            systematic review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between
            130 – 140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.[127]

2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should
            receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal
            disease, cardiovascular events, and death.[128] There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)
            are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),[129] or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease.[130] Although a more recent review found similar effects of
            ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes.[131] There is no evidence that combining ACEIs and ARBs
            provides additional benefits.[131]

The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes
            is controversial.[128] Aspirin is
            recommended by some in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease; however, routine use of aspirin has
            not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[132] 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations for
            aspirin use (based on expert consensus or clinical experience) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable
            in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease (10-year cardiovascular
            disease risk, 5–10%).[128] National
            guidelines for England and Wales by the National Institute for Health and Care
                Excellence (NICE) recommend against the use of aspirin in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who
            do not have confirmed cardiovascular disease.[121][122]

Weight loss surgery in those with obesity and type 2 diabetes is often an effective measure.[133] Many are able to
            maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery[134] and long-term mortality is decreased.[135] There is, however,
            a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[136] The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet
            clear.[135] It is recommended
            that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under
            control.[137]

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)
            affects 30% of all diabetes patients.[139] When DPN is
            superimposed with nerve
                compression, DPN may be treatable with multiple nerve decompressions.[140][141] The theory is that DPN predisposes peripheral nerves to
            compression at anatomical sites of narrowing, and that the majority of DPN symptoms are actually
            attributable to nerve compression, a treatable condition, rather than DPN itself.[142][143] The surgery is associated with lower pain scores, higher two-point discrimination (a
            measure of sensory improvement), lower rate of ulcerations, fewer
            falls (in the case of lower extremity decompression), and fewer amputations.[143][144][145][141]

In countries using a general
                practitioner system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with
            hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or
            research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care in a team
            approach. Evidence has shown that social prescribing led to slight improvements in blood sugar control for
            people with type 2 diabetes.[146] Home telehealth support can be an effective management
            technique.[147]

            cognitive or emotional outcomes.[148][149]

In 2017, 425 million people had diabetes worldwide,[150] up from an estimated 382 million people in 2013[151] and from
            108 million in 1980.[152] Accounting for the shifting age structure of the global
            population, the prevalence of diabetes is 8.8% among adults, nearly double the rate of 4.7% in 1980.[150][152] Type 2 makes
            up about 90% of the cases.[17][35] Some data indicate rates are roughly equal in women and
            men,[17] but male excess in
            diabetes has been found in many populations with higher type 2 incidence, possibly due to sex-related
            differences in insulin sensitivity, consequences of obesity and regional body fat deposition, and other
            contributing factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco smoking, and alcohol intake.[153][154]

The WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause
            of death.[155][152] However, another
            2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of
            cardiovascular disease and other associated complications (e.g. kidney failure), which often lead to
            premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[152][156] For example, in 2017, the International
                Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that diabetes resulted in 4.0 million deaths worldwide,[150] using modeling to
            estimate the total number of deaths that could be directly or indirectly attributed to diabetes.[150]

Diabetes occurs throughout the world but is more common (especially type 2) in more developed countries. The
            greatest increase in rates has, however, been seen in low- and middle-income countries,[152] where more than
            80% of diabetic deaths occur.[157] The fastest
            prevalence increase is expected to occur in Asia and Africa, where most people with diabetes will probably
            live in 2030.[158] The increase in
            rates in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including
            increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition,
            marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and
            saturated fats, sometimes referred to as the "Western-style" diet).[152][158] The global number of diabetes cases might increase by
            48% between 2017 and 2045.[150]

History of diabetes
Diabetes was one of the first diseases described,[160] with an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE mentioning "too great emptying of the urine."[161] The Ebers papyrus includes a
            recommendation for a drink to take in such cases.[162] The first described cases are believed to have been
            type 1 diabetes.[161] Indian physicians around the same time identified the
            disease and classified it as madhumeha or "honey urine", noting the urine would attract ants.[161][162]

The term "diabetes" or "to pass through" was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius of
                Memphis.[161] The disease was considered rare during the time of the
            Roman empire, with Galen commenting he had only seen two cases during his career.[161] This is possibly
            due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the
            advanced stage of the disease. Galen named the disease "diarrhea of the urine" (diarrhea urinosa).[163]

The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that of Aretaeus of Cappadocia (2nd or
            early 3rd century CE). He described the symptoms and the course of the
            disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of the "Pneumatic School". He
            hypothesized a correlation between diabetes and other diseases, and he discussed differential diagnosis from
            the snakebite, which also provokes excessive thirst. His work remained unknown in the West until 1552, when
            the first Latin edition was published in Venice.[163]

Two types of diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500 CE with one type being associated with youth and another
            type with being overweight.[161] Effective treatment was not developed until the early
            part of the 20th century when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best isolated and purified insulin in 1921 and
            1922.[161] This was followed
            by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the
            1940s.[161]

The word diabetes (/ˌdaɪ.əˈbiːtiːz/ or /ˌdaɪ.əˈbiːtɪs/) comes from Latin diabētēs, which in turn comes from Ancient Greek διαβήτης (diabētēs), which literally
            means "a passer through; a siphon".[164] Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. 1st century CE) used that word, with the intended meaning "excessive
            discharge of urine", as the name for the disease.[165][166] Ultimately, the word comes from Greek διαβαίνειν (diabainein), meaning "to pass through",[164] which is composed
            of δια- (dia-), meaning "through" and βαίνειν (bainein), meaning "to go".[165] The word "diabetes" is first recorded in English, in the
            form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425.

The word mellitus (/məˈlaɪtəs/ or /ˈmɛlɪtəs/) comes from the classical Latin
            word mellītus, meaning "mellite"[167] (i.e. sweetened
            with honey;[167] honey-sweet[168]). The Latin word comes from mell-, which comes from mel, meaning "honey";[167][168] sweetness;[168] pleasant
            thing,[168] and the suffix -ītus,[167] whose meaning is the same as that of the English suffix
            "-ite".[169] It was Thomas Willis who in 1675 added "mellitus" to the
            word "diabetes" as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a person with diabetes had a
            sweet taste (glycosuria). This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese,
            Egyptians, and Indians.[170]

The 1989 "St. Vincent
                Declaration"[171][172] was the result of international efforts to improve the
            care accorded to those with diabetes. Doing so is important not only in terms of quality of life and life
            expectancy but also economically – expenses due to diabetes have been shown to be a major drain on
            health – and productivity-related resources for healthcare systems and governments.

Diabetes stigma[edit]
Diabetes stigma
===============

[edit]
[

Diabetes stigma describes the negative attitudes, judgment, discrimination, or prejudice against people with
            diabetes. Often, the stigma stems from the idea that diabetes (particularly Type 2 diabetes) resulted from
            poor lifestyle and unhealthy food choices rather than other causal factors like genetics and social
            determinants of health.[174] Manifestation of
            stigma can be seen throughout different cultures and contexts. Scenarios include diabetes statuses affecting
            marriage proposals, workplace-employment, and social standing in communities.[175]

Stigma is also seen internally, as people with diabetes can also have negative beliefs about themselves.
            Often these cases of self-stigma are associated with higher diabetes-specific distress, lower self-efficacy,
            and poorer provider-patient interactions during diabetes care.[176]

Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with higher prevalence of diabetes compared to
            non-minority individuals.[177] While US adults
            overall have a 40% chance of developing type 2 diabetes, Hispanic/Latino adults chance is more than 50%.[178] African Americans also are much more likely to be
            diagnosed with diabetes compared to White Americans. Asians have increased risk of diabetes as diabetes can
            develop at lower BMI due to differences in visceral fat compared to other races. For Asians, diabetes can
            develop at a younger age and lower body fat compared to other groups. Additionally, diabetes is highly
            underreported in Asian American people, as 1 in 3 cases are undiagnosed compared to the average 1 in 5 for
            the nation.[179]

People with diabetes who have neuropathic symptoms such as numbness or tingling in feet or hands are twice as
            likely to be unemployed as those
            without the symptoms.[180]

In 2010, diabetes-related emergency room (ER) visit rates in the United States were higher among people from
            the lowest income communities (526 per 10,000 population) than from the highest income communities (236 per
            10,000 population). Approximately 9.4% of diabetes-related ER visits were for the uninsured.[181]

The term "type 1 diabetes" has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes,
            juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the term "type 2 diabetes" has
            replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and
            noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard
            nomenclature.[182]

Diabetes mellitus is also occasionally known as "sugar diabetes" to differentiate it from diabetes insipidus.[183]

Diabetes can occur in mammals or reptiles.[184][185] Birds do not develop diabetes because of their unusually
            high tolerance for elevated blood glucose levels.[186]

In animals, diabetes is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly
            affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male
            cats are more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are
            particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature
                Poodles.[187]

Feline diabetes is strikingly similar to human type 2 diabetes. The Burmese, Russian Blue, Abyssinian, and Norwegian Forest
            cat breeds are at higher risk than other breeds. Overweight cats are also at higher risk.[188]

The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals
            are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals.
            The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of
            emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.[187]
