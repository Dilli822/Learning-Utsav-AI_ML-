## USE SMALL SIZED 300X300 IMAGES
##### Explanation:
###### Model: 
The CNN model is created using Conv2D layers, MaxPooling2D for downsampling, and Dense layers for the final prediction. The final layer uses softmax to predict object classes.
###### Training: 
The model is trained using CIFAR-10 as a placeholder, but you can replace it with a dataset that contains bounding box labels for object detection.
###### Object Detection: 
A dummy function object_detection is included to show how predictions can be made, but this should be adapted for real bounding box-based object detection.

#### Image Classification with URL Input

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and allows users to input image URLs for predictions.

##### Steps Explained

1. **Import Libraries**:
   - Imports TensorFlow, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Requests for model building, image processing, and downloading.

2. **Load and Preprocess Data**:
   - The `load_data` function retrieves the CIFAR-10 dataset and normalizes pixel values.

3. **Define Class Names**:
   - A list of class names for the CIFAR-10 dataset is created for labeling predictions.

4. **Create CNN Model**:
   - The `create_model` function defines a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, flattening, and dense layers.

5. **Train the Model**:
   - The `train_model` function trains the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and returns the training history.

6. **Object Detection Simulation**:
   - The `object_detection` function preprocesses an input image, makes predictions, and simulates a bounding box around the detected object.

7. **Plot Training History**:
   - The `plot_history` function visualizes training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

8. **Load Images from URLs**:
   - The `load_image_from_url` function downloads an image from a specified URL and converts it for processing.

9. **User Interaction via While Loop**:
   - A while loop prompts the user for an image URL to classify. The user can type "exit" to terminate the loop.

10. **Error Handling**:
    - Basic error handling is included to manage issues when loading images.

###### Workflow Summary
- **Training Phase**: The model learns to classify images into ten categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **User Interaction Phase**: Users can classify images from URLs, and the model simulates bounding boxes around predicted objects.
- **Visualization**: Predictions are displayed with bounding boxes and labels, along with the training history for performance evaluation.
