##### Step-by-Step Process

###### Import Necessary Libraries:
Load libraries for building and training the model, plotting graphs, handling numerical data, and processing images from URLs.
Load the MNIST Dataset:
Use the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is divided into training and test sets.

###### Normalize Image Data:
Scale pixel values of images from a range of 0-255 to a range of 0-1. This normalization helps improve the training efficiency and performance of the model.
Reshape the Data:

Reshape the images to add an additional dimension, which is necessary for processing grayscale images in a CNN.

###### Build the CNN Model:
Create a sequential model consisting of:
Convolutional layers to extract features from images.
MaxPooling layers to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps, retaining important features while minimizing computational load.
Fully connected (dense) layers to classify the extracted features into digit categories.

###### Compile the Model:
Specify the optimizer (Adam), loss function (sparse categorical cross-entropy), and metrics (accuracy) for evaluating the model's performance during training.


###### Train the Model:
Fit the model to the training data while also validating its performance using a portion of the training data. Monitor how well the model learns the training data over multiple epochs.

###### Evaluate the Model:
Test the model on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy in classifying unseen images.

###### Check Model Fit:
Analyze the training and validation accuracies to determine if the model is overfitting (learning noise rather than generalizing) or underfitting (not learning enough).

###### Plot Accuracy and Loss:
Visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss over the epochs to better understand the model's learning progress and performance.

###### Predict a Custom Image from URL:
Allow the user to input a URL for an image of a handwritten digit.
Fetch the image, process it (resize and normalize), and use the trained model to predict the digit.
Display the predicted digit along with the image.

###### Final Steps
Execution: Run the complete process in a suitable programming environment that supports the required libraries (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
User Interaction: When prompted, provide a valid URL that leads to an image of a handwritten digit.
Results: Observe the output, which includes the predicted digit and the visual representation of the processed image.
